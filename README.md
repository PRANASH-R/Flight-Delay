Introduction

Over the last twenty years, air travel has become increasingly popular among travelers due to its speed and, in some cases, 
comfort. As a result, there has been a significant growth in air traffic. However, this growth has also led to a rise in aircraft 
delays, both on the ground and in the air. These delays have substantial economic and environmental impacts.

This repository aims to address the issue of flight delays by accurately predicting flight arrival delays. 
By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can optimize flight operations and minimize delays. The model 
takes various features into account, such as departure date, departure delay, distance between airports, and 
scheduled arrival time, to predict whether a flight will experience a delay.

Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts flight 
arrival delays. The model utilizes a decision tree classifier, which takes a feature vector as input. This feature vector 
includes information such as the departure date, departure delay, distance between airports, and scheduled arrival time. 
By analyzing these features, the model predicts whether a flight will be delayed or not.

In this context, a flight is considered delayed if the difference between the scheduled and actual arrival times is greater than 15 minutes.
